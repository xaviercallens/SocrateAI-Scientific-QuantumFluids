Formalisation of the conjugated complexification's energy conservation.

Closes audit ruling O2 of docs/designs/M2_W4_DISPERSIVE_SHELL.md, which
accepted the complexification as a labelled deformation "carrying no Tier A
backing until it has its own Lean development".

Deliberately mirrors MechanicaFluidorum's real-model development
(lean_src/DyadicShell_Statements.lean: `shellB`, `sum_mul_shellB`,
`shellB_energy_conservation`) so the two can be compared line for line, and
against the SAME pinned Mathlib revision, so a theorem here is checked
against the same library every result in that stream's LEDGER was verified
against.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT PROVED HERE. This file proves the algebraic identity that
the complexified nonlinearity conserves the energy pairing exactly. That is
the single load-bearing claim under W4's model -- memo section 2b, and the
property that makes the complexification usable at all. It says nothing about
boundedness, blow-up, or the dispersive regulator's effect on any observable;
those are Tier B or open.

/-- The complexified Katz-Pavlović shell nonlinearity, in the CONJUGATED form
selected by memo section 2b:

  `B_0(v)     = -(k_0 * conj(v_0) * v_1)`
  `B_{m+1}(v) = k_m * v_m^2 - k_{m+1} * conj(v_{m+1}) * v_{m+2}`

Squares are written as explicit products rather than `^2` to keep every
`Complex.re` expansion below a product of at most three factors, which `simp`
plus `ring` handles directly.

The single conjugation on the OUTGOING term is what makes the energy
cancellation work; the unconjugated version does not conserve (measured
numerically at ~1e+3 in exploration/verify_complexification.py). It is not
the unique conserving choice -- see memo section 2c(iii); it is chosen for
the invariant-subspace property proved as `shellBc_real` below. -/

/-- **The identity that makes the cancellation work.**
`Re(conj(a)^2 * b) = Re(conj(b) * a^2)`.

Both sides are the real part of a pair of complex conjugates: applying
`starRingEnd` to `conj(a) * conj(a) * b` gives `a * a * conj b`, and
conjugation preserves the real part. This is the formal content of the
hand-derivation in memo section 2b. -/

/-- **Exact energy conservation for the complexified model (Tier A).**

Under the truncation boundary condition `v_{N+1} = 0`, the conjugated
complexified nonlinearity conserves the energy pairing exactly:
`Σ_{n≤N} Re(conj(v_n) · B_n(v)) = 0`, i.e. `d/dt (½ Σ |v_n|²) = 0` along the
nonlinear flow.

This is the complex counterpart of MechanicaFluidorum's
`shellB_energy_conservation`, and the formal backing audit ruling O2 required
before W4's model could carry a Tier A claim. -/

/-- **The reals are an invariant subspace.**

On real data the conjugation is inert, so `shellBc` returns a real number.
This is what makes MechanicaFluidorum's real Katz-Pavlović solutions -- including
the Katz-Pavlović finite-time blow-up solutions of the inviscid infinite system --
solutions of this model too, which is why the memo's O5 falsification trap survives
the change of model (memo section 2c(i)). Verified numerically to exactly 0.0;
here it is exact by construction. -/

/-! ## Liouville: the complexified flow is volume-preserving (shell-local part)

The review of 2026-08-14 (M2_REPORT §6b) established numerically that the realified
flow of the conjugated complexification has phase-space divergence ~4e-9 (round-off),
while the REAL Katz-Pavlović model has divergence `-Σ k_n a_{n+1} ≠ 0`. This section
formalises the algebraic core of that result.

SCOPE, stated precisely. `dv_n/dt` depends on `v_n` itself only through
(a) the outgoing term `-k_n · conj(v_n) · v_{n+1}` — an ℝ-linear map in `v_n` for
fixed `v_{n+1}` — and (b) the dispersive rotation `-(i D k_n²) v_n`. The phase-space
divergence is the sum over shells of the ℝ-trace of these diagonal blocks. The
theorems below prove each such trace is ZERO. What is NOT formalised here is the
differentiation-level statement that these maps ARE the diagonal blocks of the flow's
derivative — that step is by inspection of `shellBc` and is verified numerically
(finite-difference Jacobian trace, exploration record in M2_REPORT §6b). Tier A for
the trace identities; Tier B for the assembled model statement. -/

by `c` on ℂ ≅ ℝ² is `2·Re c`. -/

/-- **Dispersive block has zero trace**: multiplication by a purely imaginary constant
`d·I` (the quantum-pressure term has `d = -D k²`) preserves phase-space volume. -/

/-- **Outgoing block has zero trace**: for every fixed `w`, the ℝ-linear map
`v ↦ conj(v) · w` has zero trace. This is why the conjugated nonlinearity —
unlike the real Katz-Pavlović form, whose divergence is `-Σ k_n a_{n+1}` —
contributes nothing to the phase-space divergence. -/

/-- **Shell-diagonal divergence vanishes.** The full diagonal block at shell `n` —
outgoing conjugated term (with `w = -k_n·v_{n+1}` folded into `w`) plus dispersive
rotation — has zero ℝ-trace. Summed over shells this is the Liouville property of
the complexified model. -/
